# Spacenvim

My personal neovim config forked from [ayamir/nvimdots](https://github.com/ayamir/nvimdots).

## Install

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fioncat/spacenvim/HEAD/scripts/install.sh)"
```

## Copilot

By default, [copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is enabled, you need to run `:Copilot auth` to start the authentication process.

After authentication is done, then you are ready to use copilot!
